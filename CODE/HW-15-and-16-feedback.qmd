Overall nice job! You might take a look at the leve of headings you use. It feels a little like being shouted at to read some of your bold ones!

## Yelling but not so loud

You did a good job adding a lot of "scientific thinking" outside of your code chunks. Now think about also adding some comments to your code chunks, e.g.

```{r}
#here is a comment inside of a code chunk
```

so that future you can remember how the code works.

## Homework 16 Feedback

You don't have the percent cover data inside of your project DATA folder (you have squirrel data, not percent cover data) so I can't run your code. Please be careful that in future your data for your project are all inside of your DATA folder.

I read through your code, and it looks good, but I wan't able to run it.
